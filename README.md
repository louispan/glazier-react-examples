# installation dependecies
* stack
* node
 - This gives the npm package manager.
 - node is required for ghcjs anyway.

* todo example
```
cd examples/todo
make start
```
NB. the examples/todo was created using the skeleton from
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html, by running:
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app todo
```
